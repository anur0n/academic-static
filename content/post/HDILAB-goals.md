<h1>Human Data Lab</h1>
<body>
  The lab is run by Dr.Deokgun Park at University of Texas at Arlington. The core area of interest is Artificial General Intelligence(AGI).
  The goals of the lab are explained in [these videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTM6ZLB6tl32YpFNsj1U53WwKXa1SQ3Bx) .

<h2>My goals</h2>

  I have two main goals that I am working on over the summer 2019.
  
  * Building virtual environment for incubation of AI.
  * Understanding and implementing the Hierarchical Temporal memory(HTM) algorithm.
  
<h3>Virtual environment for AI:</h3>

<body>
   Using Unity3D, learn develop a simulation/ a game that can be played by an AI similar to [Obstacle Tower challenge] (https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/unity-obstacle-tower-challenge) .
   I am familiar with Blender for creating animations and have started to learn animation with unity3D. Some of the tasks include animation from motion capture data,
   both face and body.
   Faceware Live is the face motion capture software that has a plug-in for unity3D. The challenge would be in creating a seamless virtual human
   behaviour within the game.
   Marching cubes algorithm is a handy tool for creating various terraines. This can help build a robust environment that is auto-generative.
   Generative adversarial Networks come handy when you have to replicate a real-world 3D object in the game.
   The idea is to make 3D simulations that have parameters that can be fed into an AI algorithm and be controlled to play the game. 
   Additional feature would be giving access to us to play and see what the AI wouls see, a first or third person view using a Virtual Reality headset.

<h3> Temporal Memory Algorithm</h3>

<body>
   Hierarchical Temporal Memory is a hypothesis by Jeff Hawkins which is based on the working of the neocortex, the outter most part of the human brain
   This theoritical framework encapsulates the essence of intelligence and is a new approach to building truly intelligent machines.
   One of the key factors for the working of this algorithm is Sparse Drstributed representation (SDR) which, is proposed and the way our brain 
   stores information. The other concept is spatial pooling, which can be simply put as neurons that fire together work together.
   My goal is to understand the algorithm completely and implement it in a simple use-case, prediction of charecters in a sentence. 
  
  * This is a book being authored by Numenta, an AGI research company co-founded by Jeff hawkins [good read..] (https://numenta.com/resources/biological-and-machine-intelligence/).
  * **On Intelligence** is a book authored by jeff hawkins that gives the idology behind the thinking behind the human brain
