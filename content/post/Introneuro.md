**Dr.Park: _Let's start with our question, this is a question for you guys, can anybody tell me what is the difference between the intelligence and learning?_**
my question is what is intelligence what is the difference between intelligence versus learning so when you guys answer, try to make a sentence like this "intelligence is something, learning is something" okay.


>For Example **AI** and **ML**, if you think about it they are synonymus Its an open ended question.
>**Paul:** In Reinforcement learning the NLP algorithm learns to predict but does not understand what it is predicting.
>**Shadek:** Intelligence is built-in knowledge, does not require experience. Learning is from the experience in the environment.
>  *Explains his argument with the help of push block and the scenario of bike accident*
>**Rubel:** Knowledge is gained from learning, its the experience.
