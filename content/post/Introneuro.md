## **Seminar 1**

**Dr.Park: _Let's start with our question, this is a question for you guys, can anybody tell me what is the difference between the intelligence and learning?_**
my question is what is intelligence what is the difference between intelligence versus learning so when you guys answer, try to make a sentence like this "intelligence is something, learning is something" okay.

For Example **AI** and **ML**, if you think about it they are synonymus Its an open ended question.

>**Paul:** In Reinforcement learning, the NLP algorithm learns to predict the next word from the training examples but does not understand what it is predicting.

>**Shadek:** Intelligence is built-in knowledge, does not require experience. Learning is from the experience in the environment. Like in case of the visual push block where by observing the reactions within the environment the path to take is learnt,and the scenario of bike accident, when it happens multiple times we learn from mistakes and how to avoid it.

>**Rubel:** Knowledge is gained from learning, its the experience.

>**Aishwarya:** Intelligence is having the ability. Learning is what you can gain from the environment.

>**Sanath:** Intelligence is the ability to learn new things and associate them, learning is the process of knowing how to perform a task in a given environment. If something can learn it does not mean it's intelligent, as intelligence is the ability to learn multiple things.

>**Sanjay:** You can learn something by repeating  it over and over again. It is done by gaining experience. Intelligence is the ability to learn multiple things. In case of babies they have something caleed reflective learning, like smile and cry, but to dance repetation of moves is required.

**Dr.Park:** Okay you guys are all making good points but when it comes to thinking about intellingence, you guys are thinking in terms of human intelligence, it is eays but we need to think better. 
>**A fish cannot appreciate water just like humans cannot appreciate air.**

**I think we need to look at the intelligence of Human VS Bee. How many of you think the Bees are intelligent? and can it learn?**

>**Rubel:**  *I am not sure about how bees behave, he does not have enought information, he does not thnik fish are not all that intelligent because they don't learn new things.*

>**Shadek:** I think bees are intelligent.

**Dr.Park: Alright we need to define what is intelligence first, it will clear up any confusion. Given an environment you act reasonably well, then you can say that you are behaving intelligentely. If you act stupid it is not intelligent right.**

**So we can say that bee is intelligent as it looks for nectar, builds nest and acts to survive.**

>**Aishwarya:**Every species is intelligence and they behave differently in different environment. They could be behaving stupidly in the given environment but they still might have the capablity to learn to behave reasonably. That is intelligence right.  

**Dr.Park:** Okay everyone agrees bees are intellinget. are they learning new things?.

>**Sanath:** It does not learn new things it just finds various different ways to do the task.

>**Sanjay:** Ya when flowers run out of necter then bees learn to find new flowers, so they are learning.

>**Aishwarya:** I have also heard of crows the road based on traffic signal to take food off the road.

>**Paul:** I thnik when an animal learns to jump hoop by the training of the ring master, its aquiring new skill.

**Dr.Park:** Yes association is the new rule formation, so these animals are learning neww things by knowing to associate jumping throught hoops on the master's command. If a crow that has never seen the traffic signal before then it has to learn how to cross it. The lion in the jungle will not jump through the hoop if you show it one, it does not know how to.

**Okay I wil now give a concrete example that might clear up some doubts.**
As a mouse it is natural to see food and go towards it, if you see a cat run away. But if you hear the bell what do you do? There is no in-built rule for this.
**Think of an experiment where one mouse is fed food and another mouse to electric shock after ringing. So the same input gives different responses in these two mice. This is learning.**

Shadek was close to this idea, if he had only thought about it in terms of bee or mouse he would have gotten it. Intelligence is built-in knowledge and learning is aquiring knowledge. If you think about it learning is very expensive. If you are mouse you cannot experiment with the cat, a bee cannot expirement with nectar. Most of the animals hence cannot aquire new rules by learning.

Think about carracing, in smany possible events it dies. There are many which involve dieing but only few result in survival. This is crutial and difficult in animals. If a mouse dies by getting too close to a cat it has added nothing new, its life is over, no other mouse was benifited by its actions. Its actions does not have any way to leave a trace to increase the possibility that mice as a species can keep the genes, it doesn't help other mice to survive.

>**Sanjay:** What if another mouse was watching this happen? Does it not learn from observation?


**Dr.Park:** If you think about it seriously, its a bad way to learn right. there are suppose there 1000 moves in the scenario and only one , run away is right move, then this mouse has to watch all those moves to learn that it has to run away, it is lucky, old and wise but it cannot transfer this knowledge to others. That is why most animals use hard-coded rules, its easier.

There must be some point where intelligence first appeared right so let's say if we want study intelligence and we study humans to get the idea to build intelligence and look at the human only brain, okay I claim that this is a very stupid way of studying intelligence  let me give you on my argument let us say modern luxury cars that have a very complex system like auditive cruise, ABS hybrid system
GPS navigation, sound the system memory sit AC and heater and everything, so do you know how many microcontrollers in a modern car can
anybody guess how many CPUs?

>Imagine it landed in the past, How would the humans of the past understand what it is? **Without bare minimum knowledge you cannot define and implement a function for cars.**

**What are minimum parts for a car?**

Engine, axel, stearing?

>**Steam engine car.** 1769 by French inventor Nicolas Cugnot

## No. 1596

So even when locating and picking up the eraser involves many combinations of slow and fast paced movement and grabbing action requires comples palm placement, balancing and finger positioning. All components are co-ordinating and its difficult to reverse engineer the actions.

So forget about human brain, lets find minimum parts to implement learning. We need to go back to an common ancestor of mammals and reptiles.
