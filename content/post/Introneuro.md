## **Seminar 1**
<h2>   August 21, 2019 </h2>

<body>

**Dr.Park: _Let's start with our question, this is a question for you guys, can anybody tell me what is the difference between the intelligence and learning?_**
my question is what is intelligence what is the difference between intelligence versus learning so when you guys answer, try to make a sentence like this "intelligence is something, learning is something" okay.

For Example **AI** and **ML**, if you think about it they are synonymus Its an open ended question.

>**Paul:** In Reinforcement learning, the NLP algorithm learns to predict the next word from the training examples but does not understand what it is predicting.

>**Shadek:** Intelligence is built-in knowledge, does not require experience. Learning is from the experience in the environment. Like in case of the visual push block where by observing the reactions within the environment the path to take is learnt,and the scenario of bike accident, when it happens multiple times we learn from mistakes and how to avoid it.

>**Rubel:** Knowledge is gained from learning, its the experience.

>**Aishwarya:** Intelligence is having the ability. Learning is what you can gain from the environment.

>**Sanath:** Intelligence is the ability to learn new things and associate them, learning is the process of knowing how to perform a task in a given environment. If something can learn it does not mean it's intelligent, as intelligence is the ability to learn multiple things.

>**Sanjay:** You can learn something by repeating  it over and over again. It is done by gaining experience. Intelligence is the ability to learn multiple things. In case of babies they have something caleed reflective learning, like smile and cry, but to dance repetation of moves is required.

**Dr.Park:** Okay you guys are all making good points but when it comes to thinking about intellingence, you guys are thinking in terms of human intelligence, it is eays but we need to think better. 
>**A fish cannot appreciate water just like humans cannot appreciate air.**

**I think we need to look at the intelligence of Human VS Bee. How many of you think the Bees are intelligent? and can it learn?**

>**Rubel:**  *I am not sure about how bees behave, he does not have enought information, he does not thnik fish are not all that intelligent because they don't learn new things.*

>**Shadek:** I think bees are intelligent.

**Dr.Park: Alright we need to define what is intelligence first, it will clear up any confusion. Given an environment you act reasonably well, then you can say that you are behaving intelligentely. If you act stupid it is not intelligent right.**

**So we can say that bee is intelligent as it looks for nectar, builds nest and acts to survive.**

>**Aishwarya:**Every species is intelligence and they behave differently in different environment. They could be behaving stupidly in the given environment but they still might have the capablity to learn to behave reasonably. That is intelligence right.  

**Dr.Park:** Okay everyone agrees bees are intellinget. are they learning new things?.

>**Sanath:** It does not learn new things it just finds various different ways to do the task.

>**Sanjay:** Ya when flowers run out of necter then bees learn to find new flowers, so they are learning.

>**Aishwarya:** I have also heard of crows the road based on traffic signal to take food off the road.

>**Paul:** I thnik when an animal learns to jump hoop by the training of the ring master, its aquiring new skill.

**Dr.Park:** Yes association is the new rule formation, so these animals are learning neww things by knowing to associate jumping throught hoops on the master's command. If a crow that has never seen the traffic signal before then it has to learn how to cross it. The lion in the jungle will not jump through the hoop if you show it one, it does not know how to.

**Okay I wil now give a concrete example that might clear up some doubts.**
As a mouse it is natural to see food and go towards it, if you see a cat run away. But if you hear the bell what do you do? There is no in-built rule for this.
**Think of an experiment where one mouse is fed food and another mouse to electric shock after ringing. So the same input gives different responses in these two mice. This is learning.**

Shadek was close to this idea, if he had only thought about it in terms of bee or mouse he would have gotten it. Intelligence is built-in knowledge and learning is aquiring knowledge. If you think about it learning is very expensive. If you are mouse you cannot experiment with the cat, a bee cannot expirement with nectar. Most of the animals hence cannot aquire new rules by learning.

Think about carracing, in smany possible events it dies. There are many which involve dieing but only few result in survival. This is crutial and difficult in animals. If a mouse dies by getting too close to a cat it has added nothing new, its life is over, no other mouse was benifited by its actions. Its actions does not have any way to leave a trace to increase the possibility that mice as a species can keep the genes, it doesn't help other mice to survive.

![img3](/img/03.PNG)

>**Sanjay:** What if another mouse was watching this happen? Does it not learn from observation?


**Dr.Park:** If you think about it seriously, its a bad way to learn right. there are suppose there 1000 moves in the scenario and only one , run away is right move, then this mouse has to watch all those moves to learn that it has to run away, it is lucky, old and wise but it cannot transfer this knowledge to others. That is why most animals use hard-coded rules, its easier.

There must be some point where intelligence first appeared right so let's say if we want study intelligence and we study humans to get the idea to build intelligence and look at the human only brain, okay I claim that this is a very stupid way of studying intelligence  let me give you on my argument let us say modern luxury cars that have a very complex system like auditive cruise, ABS hybrid system
GPS navigation, sound the system memory sit AC and heater and everything, so do you know how many microcontrollers in a modern car can
anybody guess how many CPUs?

>There are about 50-100 CPUsin a modern car. Imagine it landed in the past, How would the humans of the past understand what it is? **Without bare minimum knowledge you cannot define and implement a function for cars.**

**What are minimum parts for a car?**

Engine, axel, stearing?

>**Steam engine car.** 1769 by French inventor Nicolas Cugnot

So even when locating and picking up the eraser involves many combinations of slow and fast paced movement and grabbing action requires comples palm placement, balancing and finger positioning. All components are co-ordinating and its difficult to reverse engineer the actions.

So forget about human brain, lets find minimum parts to implement learning. We need to go back to an common ancestor of mammals and reptiles.

## **Seminar 2**
<h2>   August 28, 2019 </h2>

<body>

**Dr.Park: so do you guys remember what we did talk about last week? I sure can you give me some idea.** 

>**Aishwarya:** the last part the gist of it was we were discussing what is the minimum machinery we need to for intelligence and we left off saying we will look at the part in evolution where the mammals and reptiles have a common ancestor 

**Dr.Park: okay and do you remember the intelligence vs learning question?** 

>**Aishwarya:**	yes we concluded that intelligence is to do with learning new things but also associating the new things to different contexts.

**Dr.Park:** that is slightly different what I think can you say it again,

>**Aishwarya:** intelligence is when you are able to associate the things that you learnet.

**Dr.Park: anyone else remember the difference between intelligence and learning?**

>**Aishwarya:** the inbuilt system that we have versus...

>**Rubel:** built-in intelligences attributes...

**Dr.Park** is learning built-in?

>**Sanjay:** if we try to associate one skill to another thing, skill let say, then that is intelligence. 

>**Sanath:** intelligence is the ability to associate new things to make new rules, for example the lion knows to jump and its knows how to feel fear, the rigmaster trains the lion by associating these together.

>**Aishwarya:** is it about making new rules?

**Dr.Park:** What is making new rule? learning or intelligence?

>**Shadek:** I think learning is making new rules and intelligence is built-in.

**Dr.Park: Oky you guys are confused. Let us concretely define intelligence and learning to get better idea.**

>if we think about ven-diagram of intelligence and learning  ![img6](/img/05.PNG)

**There can be intelligence without learning, but no learning without intelligence.**
>Example of intelligence without learning are the bees.


>Intelligence is a **rule** that works for you well-being, it is also a rule and can be learnt.
>Learning is ability to **make** new rules.

![img7](/img/06.PNG)

>Intelligence is like a program to choose other rules based on the situation, for well-being, so it makes intelligence a rule as rules are nothing but programs, a bunch of instructions.

>**Rubel:** So surviving is an inbuilt intelligence?

**Dr.Park:** yes it is.

>**Rubel:** Then how can you explain the case of suicide.

>**Sanath:** is it another form of intelligence?

**Dr.Park:** It can be built-in like in case of the bee, after it stings it dies. Well there are two scenarios that are possible, one is sacrifice, another is failure. These are edge cases.
>In case of sacrifice, you are working for the survival of species, like **Bruce willis in Armageddon** did. Here you are protecting your genes.
>Other scenario is you get so stressed out you die, like for example a lion that cannot hunt in the jungle will die. You wanted to live well but you failed. 

**Okay now we can think about how many animals actually can learn. Which do you think is larger, animals that have intelligence with learning or animals that have intelligence without learning?**

*Everyone thinks its animals that have intelligence without learning*

**Why is it so?, If you think about it, when you encounter a tiger you do not have time to think about your action to take, the running has to be built-in. Learning is expensive.**


>**Rubel:** If we consider evolution, did past species learn to survive? It wasn't always built-in right? Isn't it learnt?

**Dr.Park:** Can you give me a concrete example?

>**Rubel:** Maybe early micro-species? Bacteria and Fungi.

**Dr.Park:** How about ameoba or plankton that whales eat? They are one celled structure. Do you think they have intelligence or not? It's a very good question, as it will give us a position to fix our defination, so plankton and ameoba live well in the world, they have enough rules to do so. Multiply a lot and find food are their rules. So we can conclude intelligence right? But it does not make sense.
So we need to re-define intelligence.

![img8](/img/07.PNG)

>**Lets say there creatures without intelligence like ameoba and plankton, then to make this defination more resonable? How can we implement a rule?**

>If you consider Protiens and enzymes, high school biology, DNA is blueprint for species. So these protiens and enzymes are building blocks and makes up the parts of the species. So its a simple rule, if there is enough food then split into two, use energy to operate cutting mechanism. This is the rule implemented by DNA.

**Can anybody give me an example of how to implement a rule? Like building a program to run the motor.**

>**Aishwarya:** The links formed int he brain.

>**>Sanath:** Like a fly to flap its wings, it should know when and how to flap the wings.

**Dr.Park:** Yes the wings are controlled by some circuitry that makes decissions and sensory inputs to determiine the decissions.

>**So we can define intelligence as a system now where there has to be some sensory input, a processing region and actuator, something to reflect the actions with. This is the minimum parts to implement intelligence.**


![img9](/img/08.PNG)


>There are rules for processor that modifies the actuator based on sensory input for your well-being.

**Dr.Park:**Does ameoba have a sensor?

>**Sanath:** Its whole border is a sensor.

**Dr.Park:** This is at a protien level, I mean there should be electrical circuit.

>**Sanath:** Technically there are ion flow in carbon-based life form so its a electrical circuit right?

**Dr.Park:** It is more of a battrey, a system needs to have connections and a circuit at a higher level.

>**Sanjay:** Can plants be considered intelligence?

**Dr.Park:** Do they have electrical circuit? I don't think so. It has sensor and an actuator but no electrical circuit for processing.

>**Sanath:** So can IoT systems be considered intelligent?

**Dr.Park:** Yes it satisfies the conditions. But it is hard coded intelligence, it cannot learn new things. All smart phones and systems are intelligent nowadays.
