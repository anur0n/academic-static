title="Explicit Memory and Navigation"

This is a brief overview of the paper **Memory, navigation and theta rhythm in the Hippocampal-entorihnal system**  
linked ![here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/235376121_Memory_navigation_and_theta_rhythm_in_the_hippocampal-entorhinal_system)

Memory is the core mechanism of any living organisms. The current understanding divides memory into long-term and short-term (working). 
Long-term memory can be further divide into Explicit (Declarative) memory like facts about objects and places, semantics for language and
activities, and Implicit (Non-Declarative) memory like muscle and skeletal response, emotional response, skills and reflexes. We are going 
to discuss a specific type of long-term memory, the Declarative memory.

Understanding the mechanism has been a challenge that Neuroscientists have finally gotten a breakthrough in, this paper summarizes all 
findings and provides a comprehensive insight into the current understanding of how spatial memories are formed and recalled in the brain. 
The paper proposes that mechanism of memory and planning has evolved from mechanisms of navigation in the physical world. They hypothesize 
that the neuronal algorithms involved in real world navigation and mental space are essentially the same.

When an animal moves around in an environment, the current static position in reference frame is the first thing required, called map-based
(allocentric) navigation which uses the spatial relation of landmarks to define the relative position in the environment. Also, a second way
of calculating position based on integration of motion with knowledge of previous position called path integration (egocentric navigation) 
which also helps measure distances of and between landmarks. In exploring the surrounding any of the two navigation methods may be dominant
depending on the environment. For instance, if there are lot of landmarks or objects in a relatively large are, itâ€™s better to rely more on
the allocentric way. But if the path is narrow and has no obstacles in the way, egocentric navigation is the only way to proceed exploring.

The two main regions of the brain that were discovered to be responsible for declarative memory are the hippocampus and the entorhinal 
cortex.

The entorhinal cortex consists of grid cells, in geometric formations that are packed at different spacing along the vertical axis for 
neural representation of space, head cells which are responsible for directional reference frame and boundary cells that assist in 
allocentric distance triangulation. These help in accurately representing a map of the surrounding and the reference point giving rise a 
structure that is ideal for computing spatial metrics irrespective of the environment and the arrangement of the grid cells are such that 
variations of maps when there is change in the surroundings is also possible. This nature of the entorhinal cortex can be combined with 
the place cells of the hippocampus to form a vast number of individualized maps for various places visited over a lifetime.
