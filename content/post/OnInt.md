On Intelligence is a book written by Jeff Hawkins that proposes a new approach to understanding intelligence and building intelligent 
systems. Jeff Hawkins and his team of researchers have over the years accumilated several research papers in the field of Neuroscience 
and uncovered a hypothesis about the working of the human brain. He touches on many subjects, such as the brains ability to recognize 
patterns  and build invariant representations of the world from them, but the main idea of the book is that prediction is the key thing 
that makes the brain intelligent.  

Intelligence and learning lead to better prediction, a mistake in the prediction leads to learning. He argues that a single cell organism
is also intelligent, because it can make predictions about its environment by using its senses and its “programming” embedded in its DNA.
Going up the hierarchy, reptiles are more intelligent because they can accomplish more complicated tasks. Mammals though are even more 
intelligent due to the fact that they can not only make predictions about the world, but because these predictions can also change with
experience. They are not static (at least not all of them), a result from evolutionary _“programming”_, but they are ever changing during 
the animal's lifetime. The point here is that while prediction is the key to intelligence, it requires a complicated memory system in order
for it to work. The author calls it the “memory-prediction framework”. Humans are at the top of the “intelligence pyramid” because of their
ability to pass on information from their memories and create such memories in others without the need for the other to have actually 
experienced the memory directly.

The following figure shows how the information of sight is processed in the human brain. The eyes are connected to the temporal lobe of the 
brain through optic nerves. The information gets processed here along with the spatial information obtained from the entrohinal hippocapal and from the hypothalamus
region. We can clearly see a hierarchical architecture. At each of the sub-region V1,V2,V4 and IT different levels of abstraction of the 
input happens to understand the observed spatial-temporal pattern. This helps store sequence of recurring patterns and recall them 
auto-associatively by having them in an invariant form and in an hierarchy.

>Baddeley's Model of Working Memory is a model of human memory proposed by Alan Baddeley and Graham Hitch in 1974, in an attempt to present a more accurate model of primary memory. Working memory splits primary memory into multiple components, rather than considering it to be a single, unified construct. Thisis the main model that first intruduced the idea of hierarchy in the memory formation and recall.

**HTM** is a hypothesis that explains the workings of the **neocortex**, the largest part of the brain and how it can be implemented 
to build a truly intelligent system. The book dwells upon the idea of intelligence of the human brain and the true working of the neurons.
The key is to understand the working of neurons in the outter most layer of the brain, the **Neocortex**. There are about **six columned 
layers** in the human neocortex, highest in any mammal. The neurons are arranged in a set of column vertically and are connected 
horizontally across a layer. This can mostly be accredicted to Vernon Benjamin Mountcastle was Professor Emeritus of Neuroscience at 
Johns Hopkins University whose work reveled the true nature and working principles of a neuron in the paper Brain mechanisms for directed
attention.

Another paper that really help build and prove the hypothesis of HTM is Memory, navigation and theta rhythm in the hippocampal-entorhinal
system by György Buzsáki & Edvard I Moser, which talks about the discovery of grid cells, a special type of neurons present at every layer
that helps locate the current world position of once self, think about navigating to a destination and form a basic model of the world.
It is proposed here that memory developed due to the need of organism'smovement through its surroundings.
The paper speaks about how there are two types of views that help form the whole world model. Allocentric view is perspective with 
respect to a particular landmark in the surrounding. Egocentric view is perspective from one-self. By looking atthese discoveries Jeff
came to conclusion that there has to be a simple algorithm thatis being implemented a the fundamental level in the neocortex to 
understand and form complex association of different sensory inputs into a virtual model and recognize already observed patterns and
their combinations.

>Each system provides a unique referrence point from the grid cells, a combination of these referrence cells gives a fairly accurate representation of current location in the world.

By truly understanding the workings of this Cortical Learning algorithm we can implement it to have a brain like learning, remembering 
and predicting capablities on a system.

Further more he discusses many more interesting examples that give a accurate insight into workings of the brain and help define Intelligence.
Now that we have an overview of the book we can move on to actually breaking down the Algorithm
